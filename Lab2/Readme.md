# Shell Scripting

## script1.sh : BackupManager

A simple shell script to create a backup of files and folders, compress them, and store them into a tar archive.

### ðŸ”¹ How it works

The script starts by preparing a base tar command with the -c (create) option.

It repeatedly asks the user for absolute paths of files/folders they want to include.

After each entry, it asks if the user wants to add more.

Once the user is done, it asks for a name of the backup file.

It runs the built command and generates a .tar file containing the selected files/folders.

### ðŸ”¹ Commands Used

* **`tar -c`**
Creates a new tar archive.

* **`tar -f <filename>`**
Specifies the name of the archive file to create.

* **`read`**
Reads user input from the terminal.

* **`while [ "$option" != "n" ]`**
Loops until the user enters n to stop adding more files.

### ðŸ”¹ Example Run


```bash
[mohitch@cachyos-x8664 Lab2]$ bash BackupManager.sh 
This is a tool to create a backup of files/folders and compress them
Enter the absolute path of the file/folder
/home/mohitch/Documents/SoftwareLab/Lab2/output.txt
Any more files to backup?(Y/n)
n
What would you like to name the backup file
Output
tar: Removing leading `/' from member names

```


## script2.sh : PasswordGenerator

A shell script to generate **random secure passwords**. The user can either:

* Generate a strong random password with `openssl`, or
* Customize the password length and composition (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters).

---

### ðŸ”¹ How it works

1. Functions (`upper`, `lower`, `number`, `special`) generate random characters from defined sets.
2. The script asks the user whether they want an **OpenSSL password** or a **custom password**.
3. For custom passwords:

   * User specifies how many uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters they want.
   * The script randomly picks characters and concatenates them.
4. The final password is displayed to the user.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Commands Used

* **`$RANDOM`** â†’ Generates random integers used for selecting characters.
* **Parameter expansion `${s:$index:1}`** â†’ Extracts a character at position `$index` from a string.
* **`openssl rand -base64 N`** â†’ Generates cryptographically secure random strings.
* **String concatenation** â†’ Builds the password by appending characters in a loop.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example Run

```bash
[mohitch@cachyos-x8664 Lab2]$ bash PasswordGenerator.sh 
Enter the size of password to generate
(Generally Minimum 8, Recommended 16, Maximum 64)
14
Would you like to generate a 1.default openssl password or 2.customize this process?(1/2)
2
How many uppercase letters will there be?(1 - 14)
2
How many lowercase letters will there be?(1 - 12)
3
How many numbers will there be?(1 - 9)
2
Remaining 7 characters will be special characters

## script3.sh : ResourceMonitor

A shell script to monitor **system processes** and display the **top 5 CPU and memory consuming processes** every 5 seconds.

---

### ðŸ”¹ How it works

1. Runs in an **infinite loop**, refreshing every 5 seconds.
2. Clears the screen and prints two sections:

   * Top 5 processes by **memory usage**.
   * Top 5 processes by **CPU usage**.
3. Press `Ctrl+C` to exit.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Commands Used

* **`ps -e -o pid,ppid,comm,pmem --sort=-%mem`** â†’ Lists processes sorted by memory usage.
* **`ps -e -o pid,ppid,comm,pcpu --sort=-%cpu`** â†’ Lists processes sorted by CPU usage.
* **`head -n 6`** â†’ Takes header + top 5 results.
* **`while true; do ... done`** â†’ Infinite monitoring loop.
* **`clear`** â†’ Refreshes screen before each update.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example Run

```bash
__________________________________________________________________________________

Top 5 by Memory consumption\n
    PID    PPID COMMAND         %MEM
   1570     915 firefox          3.3

## script4.sh : BasicCalculator

A shell script that acts as a **simple calculator** using shell arithmetic.

---

### ðŸ”¹ How it works

1. Greets the user and explains its purpose.
2. Loops until the user chooses to quit.
3. Reads a mathematical expression from the user.
4. Uses **bash arithmetic expansion** `$(( ))` to evaluate the expression.
5. Displays the result.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Commands Used

* **`read`** â†’ Accepts input expressions from the user.
* **`$((expression))`** â†’ Performs integer arithmetic (supports `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
* **`while [ "$option" != "n" ]`** â†’ Loop until user quits.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example Run

```bash
[mohitch@cachyos-x8664 Lab2]$ bash BasicCalculator.sh 
This is a basic calculator that can compute basic mathematical expressions including additions and multiplications

Enter the expression to execute
5/7*9
Output : 0

Would you like to continue?(Y/n)
Y
Enter the expression to execute
5*9/4
Output : 11

Would you like to continue?(Y/n)

```
